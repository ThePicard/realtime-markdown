Firefox users need the about:config layout.css.flexbox.enabled set to true.

Nothing much here you won't find with view source. I would have made this a
gist except this way I can host the [demo][1] on Github pages.

Makes use of:

* [marked][2]
* [prettify][3]
* seriously trivial JS glue code

Idea inspired by [socrates.io][4], as it turns out it's pretty easy to make the
markdown part.
